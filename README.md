# Connection.sh

This script acts as a basic automated connectivity check for my locally connected lab devices.

The script I use directly in my lab has a few sensitive hostnames and as such has the names swapped with placeholders. 

I made this script to help reduce the amount of manual connection tests I would need to do in the event of a power loss or network failure.

I'm sure there is much better / much more efficient ways to do this such as with Ansible, but this suits my needs for now.

As always if you have any constructive criticism or advice I gladly welcome it.
